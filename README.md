# MyTripPlanner
This is an in-progress app for planning any sort of trip/excursion.

MyTripPlanner will function as an interface for people to create, edit, and share trip plans. The long term goal is to release the app on the Google Play Store.

Most of the code is written in Java, and users will be able to log in with their Google account to acces trip plans and back them up on their google drive.

The backend code is written in C++ and C# using a .NET Framework on an Azure server.
